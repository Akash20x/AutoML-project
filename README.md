# AutoML-project
This project was a task I undertook during a summer internship, with the hopes of building a fully automated machine learning model to automate the process of a data scientist. This is an ongoing project in which I hope to complete the rest of the models. The code aim is to take any set of data, preprocess it, fit many machine learning models and output the model with the most accurate prediction or least RMSE. 

The project covers 4 machine learning models built from scratch, as well as code for use of preprocessing and some use of hyperopt for hyperparameter optimisation. Furthermore, I have a working document covering the Mathematics behind the models and an aim to give some idea of how the Mathematics was translated into code. The models have also attempted to have had the hyperparameters optimised using hyperopt.
